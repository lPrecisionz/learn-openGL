overall pipeline: 
  
  1. Create Window
  2. Initialize Shader Program
  3. Initialize Vertex Array Object
  4. Initialize Vertex Buffer Object
  5. Initialize Element Buffer Object
  6. Initialize Texture
  7. Initialize Model Matrix
  8. Initialize View Matrix
  9. Initialize Perspective Matrix
  10. Game Loop


project structure: 

Class App
  static class -> run()

Class Renderer
  Window
  Manage VAO, VBO, EBO
  Manage shader programs
  Manage Textures
  Manage Matrixes '*' -> Will leave this for last, since it's still a bit clogged.

Class Window -> might be too simple having a whole class for this. 
  name
  width
  height
  size_callback()
  init()

Class Shader -> worth splitting shaders ? each one being a single object. 
  vertex shader
  fragment shader
  init()
  use()
  set_uniforms()

Class Texture
  ID
  init()
  read_from_file()

Class VAO, VBO, EBO
  ID
  init()
  bind();


-- starting to consider having a default empty constructor just so I don't have to heap allocate every single object of Renderer
