// review notes

my first read of "Hello Triangle" was really tough to grasp, I honestly don't understand most of it, but the code runs at least. 

for my next session I must re-read "Hello Triangle" and thoroughly take notes of the following concepts: 

  vertex; 
  shader; 
  graphics pipeline; 
  vertex buffer object (vbo); 
  fragment shader; 
  shader program; 
  Linking vertex attributes; 
  vertex array object (vao);
  element buffer objects (ebo)

also try to make sense of the functions 
  glBindBuffer(); 
  glBufferData();
  etc;
