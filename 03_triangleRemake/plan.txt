my plan for rewriting the triangle exercise



what do we need?

- glfwWindow
- vertex shader
- fragment shader
- shader program
- vertex buffer object
- vertex array object
- element buffer object (i'll probably have to draw a rectangle for the texture exercise)

how is the workflow? 

- initialize window
- initialize shaders, compile them and link to shader program
- initilize vao
- initialize vbo and ebo, feed them raw vertice data, attach them to VAO (dont quite remember the order of things)
- run loop

in the loop: 
  set a render color
  use shader program
  call draw for either VAO or VBO

class Renderer
  glfwWindow m_window
  shader m_vertex_shader
  shader m_fragment_shader
  unsigned int m_vbo
  unsigned int m_vao
  unsigned int m_ebo

  void init_window(char* window_name, int base_width, int base_height);
  void int init_shader(ShaderKind kind, const char* shader_source); // compiles, links? should probably break these up into even more functions
  void init_shader_program(); -> initializes shader program, links both shaders, might be a function that's called within init_shader


enum ShaderKind
  VERTEX
  FRAGMENT

class Shader
  const char* source;
  ShaderKind kind;


- in a real scenario these would definitely be broken into more classes and we'd have openGL objects stored in some sort of data structure instead of having them being just one.
