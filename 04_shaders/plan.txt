my plan for rewriting the triangle exercise



what do we need?

- glfwWindow
- vertex shader
- fragment shader
- shader program
- vertex buffer object
- vertex array object
- element buffer object (i'll probably have to draw a rectangle for the texture exercise)

how is the workflow? 

- initialize window (done)
- initialize shaders, compile them and link to shader program (done)
- initilize vao
- initialize vbo and ebo, feed them raw vertice data, attach them to VAO (dont quite remember the order of things) - testing
- run loop (done)

in the loop: 
  set a render color
  use shader program
  call draw for either VAO or VBO

class App
  Renderer m_renderer

  run();
  process_input();

class Renderer
  glfwWindow m_window
  shader m_vertex_shader
  shader m_fragment_shader
  unsigned int m_vbo
  unsigned int m_vao
  unsigned int m_ebo

  void init_window(char* window_name, int base_width, int base_height);
  void int init_shader(ShaderKind kind, const char* shader_source); // compiles, links? should probably break these up into even more functions
  void init_shader_program(); -> initializes shader program, links both shaders, might be a function that's called within init_shader
  void init_buffer(); // initialize either VBO or EBO
  void init_vertex_array();


enum ShaderKind
  VERTEX
  FRAGMENT

class Shader
  const char* source;
  ShaderKind kind;


- in a real scenario these would definitely be broken into more classes and we'd have openGL objects stored in some sort of data structure instead of having them being just one. but i'm hopeful that just structuring this the way I am will make things easier to improve upon afterwards.
